# ✋ Hand Gesture to Speech Recognition using OpenCV & AI

This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that detects specific hand signs using a webcam and plays corresponding audio messages. It’s designed to support non-verbal communication using AI, OpenCV, and text-to-speech technology.

## 🎯 Features

- Detects hand gestures with a webcam in real-time.
- Recognizes gestures like:
  - **Hello**
  - **I Love You**
  - **Yes / No**
  - **Thank You**
  - **Please**
  - **Stop**
  - **Free Palestine**
- Converts the recognized gesture to speech using `gTTS`.
- Plays audio using `pygame`.
- Displays gesture name on-screen with `cvzone`.
